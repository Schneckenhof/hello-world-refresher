# hello-world-refresher
This is a refresher on how to use github by redoing the hello-world exercise.

This is the first series of edits. 

The goal is to make a first series of edits. Then make another branch called "second series" or something.
Then test out merging the first series into the master branch and merge the master branch into the "second series" branch so i can practice using github.
