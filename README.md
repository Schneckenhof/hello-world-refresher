# hello-world-refresher
This is a refresher on how to use github by redoing the hello-world exercise.

This is a second series of edits.

The idea here is to make a branch of the original hello-world-refresher repository, then create a branch of first edits. Then create a branch of second edits. Merge the first edits into the master repository, them merge the master repository (now with first edits) into the second edits branch. Finally I want to merge the 2nd edits into the master repository.
