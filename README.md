# hello-world-refresher
This is a refresher on how to use github by redoing the hello-world exercise.


This is the first series of edits. 


The goal is to make a first series of edits. Then make another branch called "second series" or something.
Then test out merging the first series into the master branch 
and merge the master branch into the "second series" branch so i can practice using github.


This is a second series of edits.


The idea here is to make a branch of the original hello-world-refresher repository, 
then create a branch of first edits. 
Then create a branch of second edits. 
Merge the first edits into the master repository, 
then merge the master repository (now with first edits) into the second edits branch. 
Finally I want to merge the 2nd edits into the master repository.
